# Convert3x

Recursively convert \*.png -> \*.t3x from [tex3ds](https://github.com/mtheall/tex3ds)

Just run ./main.py with a directory to convert all files recursively.

Originally used for converting [Flask](https://github.com/TurtleP/Flask) metadata for other repositories.

To use, you will need to build tex3ds yourself.
